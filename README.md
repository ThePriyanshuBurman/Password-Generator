# Password-Generator

A password generator created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web tool that lets users create strong passwords. It offers options for password length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). When users click "Generate," JavaScript creates a random password according to their preferences, which they can copy and use. It helps enhance online security by generating difficult-to-guess passwords.
